	+ The permissions are:
		* Full control
		* Modify
		* Read & Execute
		* List folder contents
		* Read
		* Write
	+ Another feature of NTFS is [Alternate Data Streams (ADS)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2015/07/introduction-to-alternate-data-streams).
		*  Alternate Data Streams  (ADS) is a file attribute specific to Windows  NTFS (New Technology File System).

### Day4
- [The Windows\System32 Folders](https://www.howtogeek.com/346997/what-is-the-system32-directory-and-why-you-shouldnt-delete-it/)
-  User Accounts, Profiles, and Permissions
	+  An Administrator can make changes to the system: add users, delete users, modify groups, modify settings on the system, etc. 
	+  A Standard User can only make changes to folders/files attributed to the user &amp; can't perform system-level changes, such as install programs.

### Day 5
- [User Account Control](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/user-account-control/how-it-works)
	+ How does UAC work? When a user with an account type of administrator logs into a system, the current session doesn't run with elevated permissions. When an operation requiring higher-level privileges needs to execute, the user will be prompted to confirm if they permit the operation to run. 
- Settings and the Control Panel
	+  Control Panel is the menu where you will access more complex settings and perform more complex 
- [Task Manager](https://www.howtogeek.com/405806/windows-task-manager-the-complete-guide/)
	+ The Task Manager provides information about the applications and processes currently running on the system. Other information is also available, such as how much CPU and RAM are being utilized, which falls under Performance.
